## Games
[Hot Spikes](https://pinguinogelato.itch.io/hot-spikes) - An Arcade style platformer, I originally made this in about 6 hours at a cafe in koreatown, this is the much less buggy remade version with multiplayer

[Garbage Collector](https://pinguinogelato.itch.io/garbage-collector) An arcade shooter, destroy the programs before they take over! (made in 2 weeks)

[A Comfy Train Ride](https://pinguinogelato.itch.io/a-comfy-train-ride) I often would find myself running Microsoft Flight Simulator in the background while I got work done, trying to race and get things done before I reached a destination. I then built this "game" (screensaver?, idle view?), I planned on adding more levels but ran out of time, I want to come back to it once my main project is done (made in 2 weeks)
